I'm happy to introduce the expert in accessory dwelling unit, Mike Figueredo. He is the owner of Viridi Construction. One of the most favorite topics for us right now is a new construction accessory dwelling unit. Mike is going to be educating us. Mike's going to be sharing with us valuable information and giving us a little bit of insight as to what the ad process looks like from his end, meaning the construction and the architect and how to actually get one done.&nbsp;
