Welcome to episode No. 22 of the “Jose Luiz Morales Show.” Today I’m joined by professional appraiser Roy Villa to talk about the role appraisals play in the home selling process. Roy will discuss how appraisers determine a home’s market value and answer any and all questions you have about the appraisal process. To start, an appraisal is defined as an unbiased estimate of a property’s market value, and this estimate is based on comparable market activity for the surrounding area. An appraisal is an opinion of value, so just because one appraiser values a property at a certain price doesn’t mean another will value it at that same price too. To find out everything you need to know about appraisals, how they affect you as a buyer or a seller, and what your appraiser might not be telling you, watch this video.<br><br>[https://www.myhomeseekers.com/blog/appraisals-their-impact-home-sales/](​​​​​​​https://www.myhomeseekers.com/blog/appraisals-their-impact-home-sales/){: target="_blank"}
