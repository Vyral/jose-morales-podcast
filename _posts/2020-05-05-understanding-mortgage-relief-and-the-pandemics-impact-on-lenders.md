Recently, I was fortunate enough to sit down with Frank Salazar, co-owner and partner in Gem Mortgage, to discuss mortgage relief in the wake of the pandemic. Together, we explored the implications of the CARES Act, and he offered advice as to what may be in a homeowner’s best interest right now (depending, of course, on their specific circumstances).
