Recently, I was fortunate enough to sit down with Frank Salazar, co-owner and partner in Gem Mortgage, to discuss mortgage relief in the wake of the pandemic. Together, we explored the implications of the CARES Act, and he offered advice as to what may be in a homeowner’s best interest right now (depending, of course, on their specific circumstances). Homeowners should ask their loan servicer two important questions: “What is my repayment plan?” and “Will my credit score be negatively affected?” To hear our entire highly informative conversation, watch my latest video.
