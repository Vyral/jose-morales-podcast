Recently, I had an enlightening conversation with Ventura County real estate agent, business owner, and investor, David Albanese. David and I assessed the Small Business Administration’s COVID-19 disaster relief program that can give eligible business owners an advancement of $10,000 and a subsequent loan to help them stay afloat. How is the money disbursed? What challenges are business owners facing when they try to apply through a bank’s SBA representative? David has helped several business owners navigate this process already; if you’re a business owner or an independent contractor, you don’t want to miss this interview. To watch our full discussion, watch my latest video.
