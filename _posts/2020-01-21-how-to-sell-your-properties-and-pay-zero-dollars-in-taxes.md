On the latest episode of the Jose Luiz Morales Show, we’re joined by Mike Skoczylas of Madison Exchange, LLC. I’ve been getting a lot of questions from homeowners and investors about 1031 exchanges and how they work, and there’s no one better to ask than Mike. We talked about the benefits and disadvantages of 1031 exchanges, how you can qualify for them, and much more.
