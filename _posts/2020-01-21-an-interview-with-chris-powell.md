When I first began dealing with flipped properties, I found it difficult to find hard money lenders. The problem was actually that I didn’t entirely understand the process; a hard money loan has a specific purpose, and if you structure it correctly, there are investment opportunities to be had. **I’m joined today by Chris Powell of Commercial Loan Express**, who will be helping us better understand hard money loans and how to use them.

**For your convenience, I’ve included timestamps for the topics we discussed. Feel free to navigate to the section(s) you’re most interested in viewing:**
