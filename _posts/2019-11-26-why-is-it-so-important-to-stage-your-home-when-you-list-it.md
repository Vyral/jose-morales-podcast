If you’re considering putting your home on the market, you must stage that home in order to maximize its value. Today I’m joined by Penny Bergstrom, owner of Delicious Decors, to discuss all the benefits of staging your home and how to stage it to sell.

This is because, as Penny puts it, home staging is a marketing tool used to get your home ready to sell.
